# Touch Blocker 🛡️

A high-performance Android screen lock and touch blocker utility. Functioning similarly to iOS Guided Access or Assistive Touch, it displays a floating native overlay over specific target applications (e.g., TikTok, YouTube) and intercepts/blocks touch inputs to prevent accidental operations.

## 🏗️ Architecture: Hybrid Separation of Concerns

The project strictly follows a **Hybrid (Flutter + Kotlin Native)** architecture to guarantee zero background CPU loops, high battery efficiency, and clean memory management:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Control Panel (Flutter)     │ ◄── UI & Settings configuration
└────────────────┬────────────────┘
                 │ (MethodChannel IPC Bridge)
                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│    Background Engine (Kotlin)   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. AccessibilityService         │ ◄── Event-driven foreground app detector
│ 2. WindowManager Overlay        │ ◄── Seamless touch blocker bubble
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Frontend / Control Panel (Flutter)**: Handles UI representation, configurations, target app selection, and permissions status monitoring.
2. **Background Engine (Kotlin Native)**: Listens to event-driven OS window changes, evaluates active applications, and draws/manages the native overlay.
3. **IPC Bridge (MethodChannel)**: The communications API between Flutter and Kotlin.

## 🛠️ Features & Technical Mechanics

### 1. Event-Driven App Detector (Kotlin)
*   Implemented via `AccessibilityService` listening to `TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED` and `TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED`.
*   Uses a **thread-safe, in-memory `HashSet` lookup** for $O(1)$ verification of foreground packages.
*   **Zero Polling**: Never uses CPU loops or Timers to check the foreground application.

### 2. Seamless Single-Bubble Overlay UI (`OverlayManager`)
*   **Zero Obstructive UI**: No dark filters, locked text screens, or massive unlock buttons.
*   **Bubble Visual States**:
    *   **IDLE State**: Bubble exhibits an open lock icon (`ic_lock_open`) and `0.6f` opacity.
    *   **LOCKED State**: Bubble switches to a closed lock (`ic_lock`), drops opacity to a highly unobtrusive `0.3f`, and stretches the window layout parameters to `MATCH_PARENT` to capture and discard all touches on the underlying screen.
*   **Poros Gravity Fix**: Uses `Gravity.TOP or Gravity.START` layout properties. This allows a 1:1 mapping of layout offsets directly with screen coordinates.
*   **Coordinate Offset Recovery**:
    *   When transitioning to `LOCKED` (window expands to `MATCH_PARENT`), the bubble is shifted programmatically via `view.x = lastIdleX` and `view.y = lastIdleY` to stay in place.
    *   When transitioning back to `IDLE` (window shrinks to `WRAP_CONTENT`), the bubble offsets are reset to `0f` inside the window, and layout params `x` and `y` are restored to `lastIdleX` and `lastIdleY`.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Bubble can be dragged and repositioned smoothly at 60fps in the `IDLE` state.
*   **Anti-Accidental Unlock (Double-Tap)**:
    *   Single tap in `IDLE` locks the screen.
    *   Unlocking from `LOCKED` requires a **Double Tap** (within 300ms) on the bubble to prevent accidental inputs if the user falls asleep.

### 3. Hydration & State Persistence
*   Target applications are saved in Android `SharedPreferences` as a `StringSet`. The accessibility engine hydrates this cache on service start (`onServiceConnected`), ensuring monitoring survives application kills.
*   The master service state (`KEY_SERVICE_ACTIVE`) is persisted and queried dynamically by Flutter on app launch and resume via `WidgetsBindingObserver` to keep the UI switch correctly synchronized.
*   **In-Memory Client Caching**: App list querying uses static caching inside `AppFetcherService` to avoid slow platform channel re-fetches during page transitions.

## 🔌 IPC Bridge Method Contract

All communication passes through [LockMethodChannel](file:///c:/Users/dirga/OneDrive/Documents/Project/touch_blocker/lib/core/channels/lock_method_channel.dart) using the following contract constants:

| Method Name | Payload | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setTargetPackages` | `List<String>` | `void` | Updates Kotlin package HashSet and persists to SharedPreferences. |
| `getTargetPackages` | *None* | `List<String>` | Reads target packages from SharedPreferences to populate Dart UI checkbox state. |
| `startLockService` | *None* | `void` | Signals Kotlin to set the service state to active. |
| `stopLockService` | *None* | `void` | Signals Kotlin to set the service state to inactive. |
| `isLockServiceActive` | *None* | `bool` | Queries the persisted service active state. |
| `isOverlayGranted` | *None* | `bool` | Checks `Settings.canDrawOverlays`. |
| `isAccessibilityGranted`| *None* | `bool` | Scans enabled accessibility services to verify service binding status. |
| `requestOverlayPermission`| *None* | `void` | Directs user to the Overlay system settings page. |
| `requestAccessibilityPermission`| *None* | `void` | Directs user to the Accessibility system settings page. |

## 🌐 Localization (l10n) & Translation Support

The project is localized in both **Indonesian (`id`)** and **English (`en`)**. It utilizes Flutter's standard localization tool configured via [l10n.yaml](file:///c:/Users/dirga/OneDrive/Documents/Project/touch_blocker/l10n.yaml):

*   **Configured Output**: Generated Dart localizations are placed directly inside [lib/l10n/](file:///c:/Users/dirga/OneDrive/Documents/Project/touch_blocker/lib/l10n) (`synthetic-child: false`, `output-dir: lib/l10n`) rather than in `.dart_tool/` to keep project structure clean and visible.
*   **Formatters & Placeholders**: ARB bundles (`app_en.arb`, `app_id.arb`) support pluralization and integer formatting (e.g. `{count} dipilih` / `{count} selected`) to format numbers correctly per locale.

## 🚀 Getting Started & Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
*   Flutter SDK (3.x or higher)
*   Android SDK (API Level 23 or higher)
*   Physical Android Device (Accessibility Services and Overlays cannot be fully tested on standard Emulators)

### Permissions Required
The application uses two critical Android permissions configured in [AndroidManifest.xml](file:///c:/Users/dirga/OneDrive/Documents/Project/touch_blocker/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml):
1.  **Display Over Other Apps (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`)**: Needed to draw the overlay block window.
2.  **Accessibility Service (`BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`)**: Needed to monitor foreground app state changes event-driven.
3.  **Query All Packages (`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`)**: Needed to list user-installed apps.

### Setup and Running
1.  Clone the repository and run `pub get`:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
2.  Generate the localization files manually or let the build trigger it:
    ```bash
    flutter gen-l10n
    ```
3.  Run static analysis to ensure a clean codebase:
    ```bash
    flutter analyze
    ```
4.  Run on your connected Android device:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
5.  Give the required permission flags in the Home Dashboard screen to activate the lock engine overlay.
